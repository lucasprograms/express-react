# express-react

A foray into building a full stack app with React, Express, and Mongo.

5/14
  - laying the groundwork
    - working routing (with react-router-dom)
    - service POC (currently fetching from jsonplaceholder)
  - to do
    - set up mongo
    - determine vision for app (probably a clone of something. Hopefully not a todo app)
